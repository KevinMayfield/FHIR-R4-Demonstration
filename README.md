# FHIR R4 + Health Information Exchange Demonstration

This app demonstrates the use of UKCore and FHIR RESTful API's.

It is aimed at internal use for quickly demonstrating concepts and ideas.

It does not follow any NHS user interface conventions as it is not aimed at real users. 

The demo is available on [FHIR-R4-Demonstration](https://nhsdigital.github.io/FHIR-R4-Demonstration/)
